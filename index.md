**Hi, this is Chongbo Tang. I'm a third year computer sicence student at UCSD.** <br/> 

My favorite movie is [Interstellar.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/)
One line from this movie that I love the most is 
> We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.

My favorite video games are:<br/>
- DoTA2
- WOW
- Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

I also have a list of things I wanted to do, I completed some of them, and look forward to finishing my list.
- [x] go to a college
- [x] make some friends
- [x] remain a perfect GPA
- [ ] meet a girl I like
- [ ] graduate successfully 


*Using Github is cool. I learned how to use Github today, and I'm loving it!* <br/>
~~I love the process of trying different things.~~ <br/>
**Especially the _styling test_ here.** <br/>



### My Favorite Programming Language<br/>
The first programming language I learned is C++. <br/>
```
int a = 0;
int b = 1;
std::cout<< a + b <<std::endl;
```
Do you know what's the output?<br/>

This [relative link](README.md) will link to my README file. <br/>
