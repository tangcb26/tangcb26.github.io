**Hi, this is Chongbo Tang. I'm a third year computer sicence student at UCSD.** <br/> 

My favorite movie is [Interstellar.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/)
One line from this movie that I love the most is 
> We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.

*Using Github is cool. I learned how to use Github today, and I'm loving it!* <br/>
~~I love the process of trying different things.~~ <br/>
**Especially the _styling test_ here.** <br/>
